Wordpress Wikipedia API client plugin

Basic summary fetch for inserting it into a Wordpress post.

Work in progress, early yet working stage.  There are many leftovers from my other sources and the code is not optimized nor organized/formatted. There are many boilerplates left ready for further development.

Depending on the language the URLs supplied by Wikipedia may use a weird encoding.
There is an user input required in that case to change the URL part by hand (temporary). 
To install just put the [plr-get-wiki-adm] folder inside the Wordpress Plugins folder.
Autoupdate is not yet enabled.

This is the one of many fixes needed so:  Use it at your own risk. No warranties of any kind.
