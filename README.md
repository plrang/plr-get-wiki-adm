Wordpress Wikipedia API client plugin

Basic article summary fetch for inserting it into a Wordpress post.

This is a work in progress, early yet working stage.  There are many leftovers from my other sources and the code is not optimized nor organized/formatted. There are many boilerplates left ready for further development.

Depending on the language the URLs supplied by Wikipedia may use some weird encoding. There is an user input required in that case to change the URL part by hand (temporary). This is the one of many fixes needed so:  Use it at your own risk. No warranties of any kind.

To install just put the [plr-get-wiki-adm] folder inside the Wordpress Plugins folder.
Autoupdate is enabled. The plugin package is hosted under: https://plrang.com/plr-plugins/plr-get-wiki-adm-upd/plr-get-wiki-adm.zip

It could be hosted on Github, but GH adds the branch suffix to the file name, which would force me to change that name in many places. [At the moment] it's not an issue I want to cover.
