Wordpress Wikipedia API client plugin

This "article summary fetch" is a work in progress, in the early stages of development. The code is not optimized or well-organized, and there are many boilerplates left for further development. Please note that depending on the language, Wikipedia URLs may use unusual encoding, requiring manual input to adjust the URL temporarily.
As such, use the plugin at your own risk, with no warranties of any kind.

To install, simply place the [plr-get-wiki-adm] folder inside the WordPress Plugins folder or clone it. Autoupdate is enabled, and the plugin package is hosted at https://plrang.com/plr-plugins/plr-get-wiki-adm-upd/plr-get-wiki-adm.zip. Although the plugin could be hosted on Github, doing so would force the file name to change in many places due to the branch suffix, which is not currently a priority.

Note that this plugin is not yet optimized and should be used with caution.
